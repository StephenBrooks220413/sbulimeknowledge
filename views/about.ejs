                My <strong>journey</strong> that started this program began in 2018. I left my job and career behind to help care for my mother who was ill. In that moment of surrendering my life to care for someone else I had many questions about life. Why was I placed into this alignment? How was I gonna pay my bills? What would my future look like? When I looked at my mother who was the main source of unconditional love in my life I knew that I just had to do it. Not only did I have to take care of her I made it my goal to take the best care I possibly could of her. An amazing bond was built between us a bond of unconditional love, forgiveness and appreciation of life was unfolding.

                Something I never fully understood until being confronted with this situation. I spent most of my downtime meditating, studying and learning. This was my way of dealing with the sometimes very stressful life associated with caring for someone who is disabled and struggling with daily functions. I’d meditate to calm myself down for me to fall asleep. A few nights I’d wake up with a profound desire to write. This occurred for quite a few months. I would write and write and sometimes I didn’t even understand what I was writing and the following day I’d research what I wrote to truly understand it. The <i>Intuitive Ascending Mind Program</i> was being created.

                  data-mdb-animation-delay="300">
                In the beginning I would just stare at my writing to understand it’s purpose. Time would show me I created it as a blueprint for my own life. Guidance that was so powerful that I could endure any hardships that came my way. My mother passed in March, 2021. This was not an easy time but her unconditional love was so present and her last words to me was ‘I love you baby’ I am so grateful for that moment. I took a year for myself to focus on healing, traveling and being grateful for my significant other who quickly stepped up pouring his love into my life. Love and Compassion is the greatest gift we could ever give and receive from the universe.

                    I hope to share this Program with the world. I’ve simplified the information to make it as easy to use as possible. This is powerful knowledge. The Program is based on truth don’t take my word for it, I encourage you to do your own research and development. My goal is to help everyone live a purposeful life and expand their life and love through self correction. Start your journey today.
